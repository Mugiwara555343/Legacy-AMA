# Initial Setup Log â€“ June 26, 2025

## Repository: persistent-ai-architecture

### Overview:
This project is the early framework for a persistent memory system, capable of receiving and responding to local data changes (emotional logs, task updates, system feedback), and ultimately syncing them with a context-aware assistant powered by OpenAIâ€™s API stack.

---

### âœ… Setup Actions Completed:
- Created GitHub repo with public visibility
- Committed initial folder structure:
  - `/scripts`: Python logic for file watching and parsing
  - `/memory`: Modular logs in `.json` format
  - `/logs`: Development activity, decisions, and notes
- Drafted `README.md` to reflect scope and goals
- Created `todo.md` to manage development flow

---

### ðŸ”§ File Watcher Script:
- `file_watcher_v1.py` added
- Uses `watchdog` to monitor `/logs` and `/memory` folders
- Will trigger downstream parsing and assistant memory ingestion
- Logging output visible in terminal for each file update event

---

### ðŸ§  Project Notes:
- Companion logs and personal dialogue with assistant are excluded from GitHub
- This repository is for **technical development only**, toward the broader goal of a self-organizing, context-aware assistant
- Future additions will include dockerized local LLM containers, n8n-triggered memory routing, and log summarization modules
