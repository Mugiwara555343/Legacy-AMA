# ðŸ§  Script Modules â€“ Core Memory Automation

This folder contains the core Python automation scripts powering the persistent AI memory system. Each script is modular, testable, and structured for local execution â€” ensuring privacy, reliability, and full system control.

These scripts handle real-time file watching, parsing, and memory log generation, forming the backend of a local LLM-powered architecture.
