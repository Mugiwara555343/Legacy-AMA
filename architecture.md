# üß† Architecture Overview ‚Äì AI Memory System

This document outlines the architecture behind the **AI Memory Architecture** project ‚Äî a modular, local-first system designed for cognitive reflection, emotional processing, and long-term memory simulation using multi-model LLM chaining.

The system is structured to scale across multiple interfaces, models, and sensory layers (voice, image, text), while remaining fully local, extensible, and privacy-preserving.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Goals

- Process human-readable `.md` logs into structured memory files (`.json`)
- Parse emotional tone, intensity, and tags from daily reflections
- Route memory logs to appropriate local models (emotion, logic, synthesis)
- Enable real-time interaction via voice (Whisper + ElevenLabs)
- Visualize logs through future scene renderers (ComfyUI)
- Maintain a fully offline, scriptable, and modular stack
