# Shoulder Recovery & Bulletproofing Protocol
**Date:** 2025-06-24

## 🩹 Recovery Context

- Injury likely caused by overuse during pushups and dominant-arm strain.
- Pain especially present with:
  - Arm across body (horizontal adduction)
  - Lateral raises (T-pose movement)
  - Reaching across to opposite shoulder
  - Rotating arm with palm facing inward
- No pain at rest or when arm is hanging.
- Flare-ups as high as 9/10 in the morning, but calming with ice, bracing, and limited use.
- Recovery is active, emotionally disciplined, and rooted in Mau’s core philosophy: *strength through presence, not ego*.

## 🧊 Current Recovery Plan

- Ice: 15-minute sessions, especially after flare-ups.
- NSAIDs: As needed for inflammation
- Shoulder brace: Worn during activity, removed at rest.
- Avoid flare triggers:
  - Brushing teeth with dominant hand
  - Driving or reaching without bracing
  - Dressing/undressing with full shoulder rotation

## 🔁 Core-Compatible Mobility & Activation (Safe Phase)

> Intent: Promote blood flow, restore movement patterns, reestablish coordination without risking reinjury.

- **Scapular Retractions**  
  2 sets of 10 reps, standing or seated. Focus on squeezing shoulder blades gently, no shrugging.

- **Neck + Thoracic Mobility**  
  Light neck rotations, cat-cow movement through thoracic spine. Free up posture and breathing.

- **Pendulum Swings**  
  Let arm hang, gently swing in small circles and front/back/side motions.

- **Dead Bugs (Core Activation)**  
  Engage core while moving limbs — no shoulder loading. Helps reinforce trunk stability.

- **Wall Slides (Modified)**  
  Arms slide up a wall slowly, stopping at first pain. Focus is on scapular movement and control.

## 🛡️ Bulletproof Shoulder Protocol  
*For pushup prep, structural balance, and rotator cuff resilience*  
**Start when shoulder is no longer reactive (no flare-ups during daily movements)**  
**2–3x per week**

### 1. Scapular Push-Ups  
- Plank position, elbows locked  
- Let chest sink (shoulder blades come together)  
- Push shoulder blades apart without bending arms  
- 3 sets of 10–15 slow reps

### 2. Face Pulls (Band or Cable)  
- Anchor at eye level  
- Pull toward face with elbows wide and high  
- Squeeze shoulder blades at end  
- 3 sets of 12–15 reps

### 3. Prone Y Raises  
- Lie face-down, arms in a “Y”  
- Thumbs up, lift arms slightly off ground  
- Hold 1–2 seconds, control on the way down  
- 2–3 sets of 8–12 reps

## 💬 Notes & Philosophy

- Core and glute work continue during shoulder recovery (e.g. wall sits, kettlebell squats, stationary bike).
- Workouts follow a combat-ready mindset — durability > aesthetics.
- Shoulder rehab is not weakness — it’s architectural discipline.
- Movement is medicine. Ice is for acute response, motion is for long-term strength.
- Brace is armor, not crutch. Use with intelligence and remove with awareness.

## 🧭 Next Steps

- Continue Obsidian memory core for body logs.
- Reassess shoulder function every 48 hours.
- Track pain trends with movements and flare-ups (e.g. brushing, driving, lifting, undressing).
- When pain-free during T-pose motion and across-body reach, progress to controlled push-up prep.
