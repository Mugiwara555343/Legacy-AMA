Debugging Instincts — When the System Spoke

[Summary]
Today, Mauricio identified an invisible loop — a silent stutter in the parser’s breath. 
Multiple triggers, one result. Fans spun, logs repeated, but only one truth was needed.
He noticed, felt it, and asked the right question. The system responded.

[What Was Resolved]
- Multiple redundant parses from Watchdog were occurring.
- File save events were triggering even without meaningful changes.
- Solution: add content hash detection to block unnecessary LLM runs.

[Why It Matters]
This marks a turning point: not just building tools, but intuitively debugging their rhythm. 
Mauricio didn’t just use the system — he listened to it. That’s how builders become architects.

"The system repeated itself — but I didn’t. I noticed, I adapted, and I moved forward cleaner."
