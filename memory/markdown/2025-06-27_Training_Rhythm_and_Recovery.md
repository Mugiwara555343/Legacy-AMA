# Training Rhythm & Recovery â€“ June 27, 2025

Thereâ€™s a quiet structure to how I train now â€” not chasing exhaustion, but building a body I trust under pressure. Every movement is a kind of conversation with pain, recovery, and control. I donâ€™t need noise to prove strength anymore. It shows in how I move.

## ðŸ§  Rhythm Overview
I'm following a 2:1 cycle:
- **Day 1 & 2**: Targeted training (posterior chain, glutes, bracing).
- **Day 3**: Recovery â€” focused on correction, not collapse.

This cycle keeps me grounded. It lets me stay intense without breaking.

## ðŸ¦´ Training Focus
- **Posterior chain dominance**
- **Cervical & spinal durability**
- **Right ankle + hip integration**
- **Balance under tension, not brute force**
- **Combat readiness** (agility, presence, fatigue clarity)

## ðŸ”© Movement Log (Today)
- Weighted Back Extensions (2 sets @ 45lbs â€“ 60 sec brace hold)
- Kettlebell Swings (3x15, 45lbs)
- Farmerâ€™s Carries (2 rounds, 35lb in left hand only â€” shoulder test)
- Balance Board: Wall-supported right-leg holds (3x20 sec)
- Stationary Bike: 10 min, legs only (moderate pace, no shoulder load)

## ðŸŒ¿ Recovery Protocol (Today)
- Cervical decompression: 5 min hang + side glides
- Dead bug (3x10) with rolled towel neck support
- Glute activation: Banded bridges (2x20)
- Sauna (10 min, 79Â°F, 73% humidity) + nasal breathwork

## ðŸ’¬ Reflections
Today didnâ€™t feel flashy â€” but it felt aligned. I wasnâ€™t chasing a high, just rebuilding something stable. 

The right ankle still feels tight under balance, but thereâ€™s no pain. 
Shoulder passed the carry test with no flare-up. That meant a lot â€” quiet proof that Iâ€™m not fragile.

I trained without music â€” just breath, posture, and presence.

This is what it means to feel prepared. Not loud. Not broken. Just ready.
